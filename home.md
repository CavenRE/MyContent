Hello there! Glad you've landed at **CavenRE**. 
This little site started because I needed a platform of my own and also wanted to experiment with something cool—like building with **HTMX**! As you can see, the project kind of took on a life of its own. 😄

I'm a developer with a passion for all things tech and problem-solving. Every project offers a new challenge, and that's just the way I like it. I’m a freelancer, so if you're in need of someone who can get things done, consider hitting up the `contact` command for more details.

👉 **How to Navigate This Site:**
- **Type Your Command:** As soon as you begin typing, an autocomplete suggestion box will appear. 
- **Click or Hit Enter:** You can either click on the suggestion that pops up or type your command and press enter to navigate.

🔍 **Easter Eggs:** For the curious minds out there, I've hidden some Easter eggs around the site. Try exploring different commands—who knows what you might find!

Enjoy your visit, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need a hand with your projects!
